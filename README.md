Welcome to the Dr. Visits Analytics repository! This project is focused on analyzing healthcare data, specifically related to doctor visits, using Python for data analysis and visualization. By working with this project, you'll learn how to process, clean, and analyze data to gain insights about trends and patterns in doctor visits over time.


This project demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze healthcare data related to doctor visits, using real or synthetic datasets. The primary goal is to derive meaningful insights, such as:

Frequency of doctor visits by patients
Trends in visits over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
Doctor visit distribution based on specialties or patient demographics
Visual representation of the analysis
We use popular libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and numpy for numerical computations.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handle missing or invalid data in doctor visit records.
Data Analysis: Aggregate and analyze visit data to derive trends and patterns.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as:
Time-series plots for visits over time.
Heatmaps for correlations between variables.
Bar charts, pie charts, and histograms for categorical analysis.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter
